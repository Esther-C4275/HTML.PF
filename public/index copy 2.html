    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>
        I am Esther, a 20yr old trying to understand coding basis. I have a degree in philosophy and i know what is going on in your head, 'what is a philosophy major doing in the computer field?'. Well, i have genuie interest in learning this and i hope to become better; it will take time but i will get there.</p>
        <p>Prior to learning coding basis, i would say nothing interests me and because of this i had no particular hobby, but i think i have found something that has caught my attention which is coding. Though, i still struggle with being able to focus for a long perid of time and coding requires alot of focus and this is something i would like to become proficient in. </p>
        <p>Enough of that i just want soft life for myself,family and friends, and God help me with that because i am extremely financially irresponsible. AMEN</p>
